# Password Generator
Create strong passwords with more control on the character set used.

I created this application for 3 reasons:

1. The LastPass password creator just irks me. It continually has duplicates of a characters with no way to control anything useful.
2. I wanted to see what the new Bootstrap v4 is like (btw It rocks!)
3. I wanted to to use ES2015 in a real project.

The front-end is built with Bootstrap 4 Alpha. The generator is built using ES2015 (aka ES6).

## The demo requires Firefox or Chrome
